## Lab1 - Merge sort

To work with bigger stack size, you need to set the stack limit as high as you can on your machine:
```
ulimit -s unlimited
```

### Then compile the program(s):
```
make mergesort_array
```
```
make mergesort_linked
```

### And run the program(s):
```
./mergesort_array [size]
```
```
./mergesort_linked [size]
```
where **[size]** is the amount of items in an array or a list.
